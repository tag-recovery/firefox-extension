  <p>
    Tag Recovery is designed for collaborative writers in the Dreamwidth
    community. The app <strong>saves and recovers previous form text</strong> based
    on the currently logged in username and the community subdomain. Every username
    will have its own separate log of recovered form text values, so that the user
    can quickly pinpoint the appropriate text they wish to recover or continue adding
    to.

    Tag Recovery <strong>saves form text after 2500 miliseconds</strong> of non-action
    from the keyboard. In future updates, this may be customizable by the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, users can customize how many days the form text will be stored
    until it expires. <strong
      >The default is 3 days before form text expires</strong
    >. It can be changed in the extension's popup window.
